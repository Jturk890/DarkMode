# DarkMode

# Project Description

This Java Swing application provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to toggle between light and dark modes. Technologies used in this program: Java: The core programming language used to develop the application. Swing: A GUI toolkit for Java that provides a set of components for building desktop applications. This is my first ever project using Swing to build a GUI as I wanted to familiarise myself with Swing and get a feel of it.
